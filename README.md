# PROJECT: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

## A Brief Introduction
In this third repository from The Odin Project JavaScript Basics curriculum, I'm going to make a simple implementation of the grade-school classic game "rock paper scissors". The first part of this project is focused on javascript and the second part of this project is to create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) with buttons and text.

## Learning Goal
The first part of this project is to apply all that I learned in the following JavaScript Basics curriculum:
- Fundamentals Part 1
- Fundamentals Part 2
- JavaScript Developer Tools
- Fundamentals Part 3
- Problem-Solving
- Understanding Errors
- Clean Code
